        <p>The KLR is a top seller for a reason. Not because it’s high quality—the KLR pretty much exists to demonstrate the difference between durability and quality—but because it’s been on the market essentially unchanged for 25+ years, so it has a huge community and aftermarket.</p>

      <h2 id=mine>Mine</h2>
      <p>Kyle E. Mitchell of Oakland, California owns the black 2017 Kawasaki KLR650 with VIN <code>JKAKLEE13HDA91703</code> and engine number <code>KL650AEAC7072</code>, registered in California, license plate <code>23N2069</code>.</p>
      <p>If someone else tries to sell the bike, <a id=email>let me know</a>.  I will ruin their day.  And make yours.</p>

      <h2 id=why>Why?</h2>
      <p>I found myself with two ‘70s Hondas, both “runners”, but still hailing rides to make appointments I could not afford to miss.  I needed something reliable, cheap to run, and versatile enough to do fire and ranch roads, not to mention shitty Oakland roads.</p>
      <p>The KLR650 is the Jeep of motorcycles.  It looks like a scaled-up dirt bike, but it is actually a rugged road commuter.  It is simple enough to work on at home, and still comes with a tool kit.  Hailing from the 1980s, it lacks electronic fuel injection, traction control, and ABS.  It hasn’t a single LCD screen.  It does have known flaws, but the aftermarket and ownership base is so extensive that information, parts, and additions are always available.</p>
      <p>The KLR650 is not a good motorcycle.  It is not pretty.  It is not high performing.  It feels cheap, and it is cheap.  But it is excellent transportation.  I wanted transportation.</p>

      <h2 id=mods>Modifications</h2>

      <h3 id=brake>Stainless Steel Front Brake Line</h3>
      <p>I replaced the stock front brake line with a stainless line that I bought from Eagle Mike.</p>
      <p>The upgrade noticeably improved brake feel, though it's by no means excellent.</p>
      <p>Routing was a bit of a trick.  The line provided still feels and looks a bit long, though it is mostly hidden under the fairing.</p>

      <h3 id=subframe>Drill-Through Subframe Bolt Kit</h3>
      <p>Make sure your drill's chuck is wide enough to accept the large drill bit.  My Hitachi's was not.</p>
      <p>Metal shavings will go everywhere.  Highly recommend packing clean rags into the space around the carburetor and using a shop vac as you drill.  Try to keep bit lubricant off other parts of the bike, since shavings will stick in it.</p>
      <p>The large through-frame bolt is confidence inspiring.  But I think I'd feel similarly confident with replacement bolts the same size as stock, of a higher-rated steel.</p>

      <h3 id=thermobob>ThermoBob 2</h3>
      <p>I installed the ThermoBob and promptly took off on a 300 mile round trip from Oakland to South Lake Tahoe and back, in hot weather.  The ThermoBob worked as advertised, keeping the temperature readout on the dash at a consistent level once warmed up.</p>
      <p>Installation was fairly straightforward.  The worst of it was dealing with coolant dripping out of the engine once I removed the stock thermostat fitting.</p>
      <p>Cutting the stock radiator-to-pump hose was pretty easy with the provided instructions.  Leave the host clamps loose on the hose until you get it routed back in place, so that you can adjust the angles to fit.</p>
      <p>I had to idle the bike for more than ten minutes after installation to get the radiator fan to turn on.</p>

      <h3 id=crash>SW Motech Crash Bars</h3>
      <p><code>SBL.08.297.10002/B</code></p>
      <p>Fairly straightforward to install, though it involves pulling both fairings.  Replacing the fairings on the bike with the bars installed is much more difficult, since the bars hang pretty close.</p>
      <p>After a few weeks, the C-shaped clamps connecting the bars to the cradle tubes of my frame shook loose and fell off.  Replacements were available, but only on special order from Germany via the US distributor, Twisted Throttle.  I'll be using lots of threadlocker on the replacements.  They weren't cheap.  In the meantime, hose clamps help stop the bottoms of the bars vibrating against the frame, but I do not thin they would hold up in any kind of crash.</p>

      <h3 id=stand>SW Motech Center Stand</h3>
      <p><code>HPS.08.473.10000/B</code></p>
      <p>Fairly easy install.  SW Motech does very good instructions with line-drawing illustrations.</p>
      <p>The position of the lever that you stand on to put the bike on the stand is awkwardly placed.  It is not easy to get a boot on top, at least with US size 13 feet like mine.</p>
      <p>I wish the center stand leaned farther back on the stand legs with the bike on the stand, like the center stands of the older Honda CBs I have owned.  I find myself kicking the SW Motech forward under the stand, expecting it to pop forward, with no results.  The legs of the SW Motech stand hang nicely in line with the frame when stowed, but I would rather they be wider, to make the bike feel more stable on the stand.</p>
      <p>SW Motech offers a grab bar kit, to make bringing the bike up on the center stand easier.  I passed, because I have only seen it for sale at about $40.  I've had no trouble lifting the bike by grabbing the rear rack or the triangular bracket for the left passenger peg.</p>

      <h3 id=petcock>Manual Petcock</h3>
      <p>From Eagle Mike.  A Yamaha part.</p>
      <p>The direction of the fitting off of this petcock isn't great.  It points directly back toward the cover over the fuse box, making for a pretty tight downward turn in the fuel line.  I had to play with my connections and the length of tube from inline filter—connected to the stock hose from the carb—to avoid a kink in the line that starved the bike for gas.</p>
      <p>The lever on the petcock just barely clears my SW Motech crash bars.  To make it easier to operate, I drilled a small hole through the lever, and slipped a key ring through it.  That works fine, but over time the key rings tend to fatigue and splay apart.</p>

      <h3 id=plug>Low-Profile Magnetic Drain Plug</h3>
      <p>Easy enough to install.  Came with four or five spare crush washers, which was nice.</p>
      <p>The profile is low enough that I am slightly worried about rounding it off.  But it certainly doesn't stick out so far as it used to.</p>

      <h3 id=sprocket>Sunstar 16-Tooth Countershaft Sprocket and Eagle Mike Prevailing Torque Nut</h3>
      <p>The stock lock washer was a pain to pry loose, and the stock nut was very difficult to bust loose.  When I finally managed it, my breaker bar flew out of my hand onto the floor.  I was afraid I'd stripped the bolt.  Instead, it was loose.</p>
      <p>You want the bike on side stand, with the bike in gear.  You also want to depress the rear brake as you break the nut loose.  This is very awkward, even if you can straddle the bike and stand flat-footed.  Shorter mechanics will need a hand, or some kind of clamp to press the brake pedal for them.</p>
      <p>The prevailing torque bolt was much easier to install, but required a large 30mm hex socket.</p>
      <p>The change is most noticeable from a stop.  It's much easier to stall the bike. The RPM difference at high speed isn't all that impressive, but might be worthwhile for long road trips.</p>
      <p>On a nearly new bike, the larger countershaft sprocket moved the chain adjusters up just past the front-most alignment indicator lines.</p>

      <h3 id=guards>Removed Hand Guards</h3>
      <p>Easy to remove, especially if you leave the stock spacers in place.  On my bike, they are matching black, and hardly noticeable.</p>
      <p>This was mostly preference.  I <em>think</em> I could feel air resistance at highway speed with the stock guards, but perhaps I am deceiving myself.</p>

      <h3 id=switch>Removed Side Stand Switch</h3>
      <p>Easy enough to remove the housing and switch.  Leaves unsightly routing tabs on the frame.</p>
      <p>You need very small terminals connectors to mate with the blade pins in the connector from the wiring harness.  Jump one pin to the other.</p>

      <h3 id=screen>Zero Gravity Sport Touring Windscreen</h3>
      <p>Easy to install.</p>
      <p>Makes a big difference.</p>
      <p>The top of the screen wobbles a bit in the wind at speed.  Mounting something with more weight on the inside may help.</p>

      <h3 id=risers>Kemimoto Handlebar Risers</h3>
      <p>The included bolts fit the bike fine.  Mark your bars where where the stock clamp meets the mount before disassembly.  Take your time torquing them in increments, to make sure they do in evenly.</p>
      <p>Even more upright.  Even further back.  A nice upgrade for this taller rider.</p>

      <h2 id=consumables>Consumables</h2>

      <h3 id=oil>Rotella T6</h3>
      <p>Cheap.  Readily available.  MA-rated (check the back label), though not sold as a motorcycle oil.  Full synthetic.</p>

      <h3 id=filter>Wix 24951</h3>
      <p>Comes with the o-ring, unlike the UNI.  Cheap.  Stocked in major chain auto-parts stores.</p>

      <h3 id=coolant>O’Reilly House Brand 50/50 Coolant</h3>
      <p>Ethylene glycol and water.  Works fine.</p>

      <h2 id=tips>Tips</h2>

      <h3 id=left-fairing>Left-Side Fairing Replacement</h3>
      <p>I strongly suggest this order:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Slide the plug-pins of the radiator cover into their slots.</li>
        <li>Place the fairing back on the bike.</li>
        <li>Thread the bolt at the back, top of the fairing just far enough in to catch.</li>
        <li>Thread the bolt at the bottom through the fairing, radiator bracket, and radiator cover bracket just far enough to catch.</li>
        <li>Thread the bolt at the top, within the fairing through the radiator cover, radiator, and fairing just far enough to catch.</li>
        <li>Pop the plastic tab of the fairing into the rubber grommet.</li>
        <li>Tighten the bolts.</li>
        <li>Insert the plastic ring between the dash cowl and fairing, and screw in the button-head bolt.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id=faq>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3 id=freeway>Freeway?</h3>
      <p>The KLR is perfectly capable of US highway speeds, completely stock.</p>
      <p>You won’t have the face-melting surplus passing power of a big-displacement sport or naked bike, but you'll be able to pass others doing 65 or 70 as you might in a common car or truck.</p>

      <h3 id=vibration>Vibration?</h3>
      <p>You will feel noticeable vibration running the bike at freeway speeds.  Over long periods without rest, it will numb your hands, feet, and rear.</p>
      <p>On decent roads, rear-view mirror visibility will not be greatly affected.</p>
      <p>The vibration can loosen fasteners.  Use medium-strength threadlocker rated for hand-tool disassembly, like Loctite 243.</p>

      <h3 id=beginners>Beginner Bike?</h3>
      <p>Maybe.</p>
      <p>Pro:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Versatile.  You can try both on- and off-road riding.</li>
        <li>Inexpensive.  Especially used.  Lots of parts.</li>
        <li>Information.  Lots available online.</li>
        <li>Simple.  Easier to maintain.</li>
        <li>Commuter.  Very practical.  Helps get miles.</li>
        <li>Power.  Relatively little, for its displacement.  Enough.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Con:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No ABS.  No-brainer for beginners riding street.</li>
        <li>Tall.  Harder, even for tall riders.</li>
        <li>Compromise.  Not great for honing sport or offroad skills.</li>
        <li>Plastic.  Lots to break.</li>
        <li>Carbureted.  Needs cleaning.  Temperamental.  More to learn.</li>
        <li>Limited.  A few keep them.  Most want to specialize (dirt bike, sportbike) or upgrade (Africa Twin, KTM, GS) pretty quickly.</li>
      </ul>
